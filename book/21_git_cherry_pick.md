## Getting it Back: `git cherry-pick`

We just learned how reflog can help us find local changes that have been discarded. So what if:

### You Just Want That One Commit

Cherry picking allows you to pick up a commit from your reflog or another branch of your project and move it to your current branch. Right now, your file directory and log should look like this:

```sh
$ ls
README.md
$ git log --oneline
84nqdkq initializing repo with README
```

Let's cherry pick the commit where we added file 4:

1. Find the commit ID where you added file4.md: `git reflog`
1.  Cherry-pick that commit: `git cherry-pick <SHA>`

Now when you view your directory and log, you should see:

```sh
$ ls
file4.md
README.md
$ git log --oneline
eanu482 adding file 4
84nqdkq initializing repo with README
```

Is the commit ID the same as the one you used in the cherry pick command? Why or why not?

> Remember, when using any commands that change history, it's important to make these changes before pushing to GitHub. When you change a commit ID that has been pushed to the remote, you risk creating problems for your collaborators.

### Oops, I Didn't Mean to Reset

Sometimes, you `git reset --hard` a little further than intended and want to restore that work. The good news is, that `git reset --hard` doesn't just work by going back in time, it can also go forward:

1. View the history of everywhere HEAD has pointed: `git reflog`
1. Reset to the point in time where the original `file6.md` was created: `git reset --hard <SHA>`
1. See your restored history: `git log --oneline`

Take a look at the commit IDs in `git log --oneline` compared to `git reflog`. What do you notice?

> Why didn't this command cause a merge conflict since we had already cherry-picked file 4. The reason is that `git reset --hard` is not trying to merge the two histories together, it is simply moving the branch to point to a new commit. In this case, this was what we wanted. In other cases, this could cause us to loose any work we may have done after the original reset.
